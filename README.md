## Features

### Display & Interface
- **3.5" ILI9488 SPI TFT Touchscreen** (480x320 pixels)
- Resistive touch input for UI
- Large, clear font display for time and date
- Automatic brightness adjustment via photoresistor (TODO)

### Environmental Monitoring
- **DHT22 Sensor** for indoor temperature, humidity readings
- Real-time sensor data updates

### Weather Integration
- Internet weather data from wttr.in (Auckland, Half Moon Bay area)
- No API key required
- Displays outdoor temperature, humidity, and weather status
- Update every 10 minutes

### Time & Clock Features
- **DS3231 Real-Time Clock (RTC)** with battery backup
- Maintains accurate time even when Pi is powered off (or when my internet dies)
- Large, readable time display

### Hardware Features
- Custom PCB design with modular connections (so i can unplug and replug the modules)
- Female header pins for easy module connection
- Compact form factor (94.5mm x 67.2mm PCB)

## Hardware Components
Please see [SmartClockPi-bom.csv](SmartClockPi-bom.csv) (Created since this is required for Highway)

## Software Features

- **Python-based application** using:
  - `luma.lcd` for display control
  - `adafruit-circuitpython-bme280` for sensor interface
  - `Pillow` for graphics rendering
- Real-time clock display with large, clear fonts. Need to test if this actually works
- Weather data integration from wttr.in
- Environmental sensor monitoring
